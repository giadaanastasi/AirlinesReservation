# AirlinesReservation
Java platform to reserve a ticket to a specific airline. Accademic version.

The idea is to create an application that allows the user to search, choose and reserve seats for a scheduled flight. Several users will be able to choose the flight they are interested in, a day and time, and finally choose the seat on that flight. The objective is therefore to obtain a WEB APP that can manage one or more bookings simultaneously and keeps the information in a persistent state.
